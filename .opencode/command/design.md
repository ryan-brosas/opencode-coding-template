# Design: $ARGUMENTS

Design a component, page, or design system with a clear aesthetic point of view.

> **Design track (optional):** Not part of the core `/create → /ship` workflow.
> Use when you need visual design guidance before or during implementation.

## Parse Arguments

| Argument    | Default  | Description                                 |
| ----------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `component` | —        | Design a specific component                 |
| `page`      | —        | Design a page layout                        |
| `system`    | —        | Create or extend a design system            |
| `[topic]`   | required | What to design (e.g. "button", "dashboard") |
| `--quick`   | false    | High-level direction only, skip code        |

## Load Skills

```typescript
skill({ name: "frontend-design" }); // Design system guidance, anti-patterns, references
skill({ name: "ux-quality-gates" }); // IA, forms, recovery, loading, usability gates
```

---

## Phase 1: Detect Existing Design System

```typescript
tilth_tilth_files({ pattern: "**/tailwind.config.{js,ts,mjs}" });
tilth_tilth_files({ pattern: "**/globals.css" });
tilth_tilth_files({ pattern: "**/components.json" }); // shadcn
```

Read what exists. Don't design in a vacuum — build on the project's current system.

---

## Phase 2: Check Memory

```typescript
memory - search({ query: "[topic] design UI", limit: 3 });
memory - search({ query: "design system colors typography", limit: 3 });
```

Reuse existing aesthetic decisions. Don't contradict previous design choices unless the user asks.

---

## Phase 3: UX Structure Decisions

Before visual design, define the interaction structure. A beautiful screen with unclear scope, weak recovery, or missing states is still failed design.

State these decisions explicitly:

1. **Primary action** — the one dominant action for the component/page/flow
2. **User-facing vocabulary** — entity/action names the UI will use consistently
3. **Scope and relationships** — what this UI affects, where the user is, and what related objects matter
4. **Dangerous actions** — destructive/bulk/account/security actions and their confirm/undo/recovery pattern
5. **State model** — empty, loading, error, success, disabled, and optimistic states required
6. **Pattern selection** — form, table/list/grid, notification, modal, or navigation pattern if applicable

Use the `ux-quality-gates` skill to keep these decisions concrete.

---

## Phase 4: Design

The `frontend-design` skill provides all reference material:

- Aesthetic directions and design philosophy
- Typography and font pairing guidance
- Color systems (OKLCH)
- Animation patterns (Motion + Tailwind)
- Anti-patterns and AI slop avoidance
- shadcn/ui component patterns
- Tailwind v4 configuration

**Before designing, state:**

1. **Aesthetic direction** — which style and why
2. **Key characteristics** — 3 specific elements you'll apply
3. **UX gates satisfied** — primary action, states, recovery, and accessibility baseline

Then produce the design:

| Task Type   | Output                                |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `component` | Spec (variants, sizes, states) + code |
| `page`      | Layout structure + section breakdown  |
| `system`    | Tokens (CSS variables) + guidelines   |

For `--quick`: Skip code output. Provide direction + key decisions only.

---

## Phase 5: Record Decision

```typescript
observation({
  type: "decision",
  title: "Design: [topic]",
  narrative: "Chose [direction] because [rationale]. Key tokens: [colors, fonts].",
  concepts: "design, ui, [topic]",
  confidence: "high",
});
```

---

## Examples

```bash
/design component button           # Full component design with code
/design page landing --quick       # High-level page direction only
/design system                     # Create/extend design system tokens
```
